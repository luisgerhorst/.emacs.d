# .emacs.d

My `.emacs.d`. Originally derived from [flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure).

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/luisgerhorst/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d`
2. Rename the file `customizations/my-private.sample.el` to `customizations/my-private.el`. You may also edit it to contain all desired values. The file will not be included in your git repository.
3. Open Emacs. All required elpa packages will be installed automatically, this may take a while.
